Med-Predict: Machine Learning Powered Disease Detection System 

Med-Predict is an intelligent healthcare support application designed to assist in early disease detection using machine learning. Built with Python and Streamlit, the system analyzes patient health parameters and provides reliable predictions for multiple diseases through well-trained classification models.

The project implements Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms to ensure robust and accurate predictions. Based on the input data, Med-Predict automatically generates a professional, prescription-style PDF medical report, making the results easy to interpret and suitable for real-world healthcare use cases.

The application features a clean, interactive, and user-friendly interface, allowing users to input patient details seamlessly and obtain instant predictions. Med-Predict is designed with practical usability in mind, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and accessibility, making it a valuable tool for learning, research, and healthcare decision-support applications.
